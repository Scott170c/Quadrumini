# `6/3/2025` - Research on Electronics Design (1 hr)
I did some calculations for the power source I need in order to power my quadruped, and I have come up with two options:
- Stay with 8 motors and have 4 DOF
- Upgrade to 12 motors and have all 6 DOF
I think I will be ambitious, and go for the 12 motors to have all 6 DOF, but the power consuption will be really high üëÄ

Also did research on motors, and I will be sticking with the MG90! I want to keep my robot affordable ü•≥

# `6/4/2025` - Research on General Design (1.5 hrs)
Today, I did some research on different types of legs, and since one of my goals is to have my robot jump I was thinking of using a compliant leg. I looked into many designs and if I do end up going for a compliant leg I will most likely be going with this one! I like it's simplicity.

On Saturday, I hope to start working on my first CAD and print out a couple iterations :)

# `6/10/2025` - More Research & CAD (3.5 hrs)
I looked into which MCUs to use and came to the conclusion that the Raspberry Pi Pico would be the best option for me, coupled with a PCA9685 Servo Driver. It is able to give me the power I need to move all 12 servos at once and keep it cost efficient :) It's power will be a massive upgrade from the Arduino Nano I have been testing with.

I also started cading the leg for the robot, and got some progress. A lil rusty with Fusion 360 so it took me longer than I would like to admit (which is why I spent so much time here) but I got the CAD done and learned how to put articulate joints on! Each leg has 3 DOF!

Because there is now 3 DOF per leg, I have decided to not design a compliant leg. I may design one in the future but I have decided to go for more degrees of freedom üï∫ over jumping ‚¨ÜÔ∏è for now.
