### Quadrumini Journal started for [Highway to Undercity](https://highway.hackclub.com/)
total hours worked: `2.5`

# `6/3/2025` - Research on Electronics Design (1 hr)
I did some calculations for the power source I need in order to power my quadruped, and I have come up with two options:
- Stay with 8 motors and have 4 DOF
- Upgrade to 12 motors and have all 6 DOF
I think I will be ambitious, and go for the 12 motors to have all 6 DOF, but the power consuption will be really high ðŸ‘€

Also did research on motors, and I will be sticking with the MG90! I want to keep my robot affordable ðŸ¥³

# `6/4/2025` - Research on General Design (1.5 hrs)
Today, I did some research on different types of legs, and since one of my goals is to have my robot jump I was thinking of using a compliant leg. I looked into many designs and if I do end up going for a compliant leg I will most likely be going with this one! I like it's simplicity.

On Saturday, I hope to start working on my first CAD and print out a couple iterations :)
