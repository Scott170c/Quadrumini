# Quadrumini Devlog
`April 27, 2024`: I decided to make a devlog to motivate me to work on Quadrumini consistently. I made a test gait back in early march but my laptop is currently being repaired so no code yet.

`October 24, 2024`: I guess the devlog did not motivat eme to work on Quadrumini consistently lol. My scheduled has freed up so I started working on redesigning the CAD for version 2
changes:
- new legs (lighter, smaller, easier to work with)
- progress on the body
- planning for a design with 3 DOF (per leg), but a baseline 2 DOF for a basic version
