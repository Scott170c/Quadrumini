# Quadrumini Devlog
`April 27, 2024`: I decided to make a devlog to motivate me to work on Quadrumini consistently. I made a test gait back in early march but my laptop is currently being repaired so no code yet.

`October 24, 2024`: I guess the devlog did not motivate to work on Quadrumini consistently lol. My scheduled has freed up so I started working on redesigning the CAD for version 2 <br /> <br />
changes:
- new legs (lighter, smaller, easier to work with)
- progress on the body
- planning for a design with 3 DOF (per leg), but a baseline 2 DOF for a basic version

`May 22, 2025`: Finally had time to get things printed and tested, the V2 works well albeit hard to set up (servo zeroing). It currently runs on 8 mg90 servos, an arduino nano, servo driver module, and 9V battery! Some small program tests I've ran have been pretty successful and it is able to carry it's own weight :) <br /> <br />
I think this is the end for the V2, and I will be starting a V3 for highway to undercity, where the 3 DOF per leg + PCB will be made (and lots of design changes to the body!)
