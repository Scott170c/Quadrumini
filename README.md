Why I made this: <br>
After watching Boston Dynamics, I was always interested in quadrupedal robots (spot) and legged robots. I have seen many different quadrupedal robots both big and small, but a common factor between them is that they are all expensive. I wanted to make my own affordable (but high quality) version at home so I could learn how they worked and enjoy having one :)
